Portfolio Website


Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills in web development, built entirely with HTML and CSS. The website includes two pages: a Home page introducing my work and a Contact page for reaching out. The design is simple, clean, and responsive, offering a seamless experience across devices.

Features

Home Page: Highlights my skills, experience, and projects.
Contact Page: Features a contact form for easy communication.
Responsive Design: Looks great on both desktop and mobile.
HTML & CSS: Structured with HTML and styled with CSS only.



Feel free to explore the code and suggest any improvements.
